# atl4s-monorepo

Modular ROS 2 platform for drone telemetry and sensor processing. A Jetson Orin Nano on the drone forwards MAVLink and sensor streams to a GPU-equipped GCP VM, which runs a pipeline of independent ROS 2 services in Docker containers handling ingestion, perception, fusion, visualization, and cloud integration. Both ends run ROS Humble.

## Pipeline (current)

```
ArduPilot SITL ──TCP 5760──▶ MAVProxy ──UDP 14550──▶ MAVROS ──ROS topics──▶ downstream services
   (in atl4s-sitl container)                          (atl4s-mavros)
```

When the real drone is in scope, SITL is replaced by the Orin Nano forwarding MAVLink over UDP to the VM's external IP on port 14550. MAVROS configuration is identical.

## Quick start (GCP VM, already provisioned)

```bash
cd ~/atl4s-monorepo
cp .env.example .env       # first time only
./scripts/dev-up.sh        # brings up sitl + mavros
./scripts/topic-check.sh   # confirm /mavros/* topics are visible
docker compose logs -f
```

Verify telemetry data is flowing (MAVROS publishes Best Effort QoS, so the `--qos-reliability` flag is required):

```bash
docker exec atl4s-mavros bash -c \
  "source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash && \
   ros2 topic echo /mavros/state --qos-reliability best_effort --once"
```

Expect `connected: true`. See [HANDOFF.md](HANDOFF.md) for the working context and current open items.

## Services

| Service | Status | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `sitl` | running | ArduPilot SITL + MAVProxy. Only starts under `--profile sim`. |
| `mavros` | running | MAVLink ⇄ ROS 2 bridge. Always on. |
| `foxglove` | planned | Browser-based visualization (`ros-humble-foxglove-bridge`, TCP 8765). |
| `web-backend` | planned | FastAPI WebSocket service for the custom dashboard. |
| `web-frontend` | planned | Browser dashboard. |
| `commander` | planned | Subscribes to telemetry, publishes setpoints back to MAVROS. |
| `bag-record` / `bag-replay` | planned | Offline development with recorded data. |
| `perception-detector` | planned | Object detection on L4 GPU. |
| `perception-segmenter` | planned | Segmentation. |
| `perception-fault` | planned | Fault / anomaly detection. |
| `perception-lidar` | planned | Point-cloud processing. |
| `fusion` | planned | Combines perception + pose into tracks / events. |
| `uploader` | planned | Recorded bags → GCS. |
| `event-publisher` | planned | Application events → GCP Pub/Sub. |
| `ingestion` | planned | Zenoh bridge for ROS topics over WAN from the Orin Nano. |

## Architecture in one paragraph

One container per responsibility. ROS topics are the only inter-service interface inside the pipeline; GCP Pub/Sub carries low-rate application events leaving the pipeline. All containers use `network_mode: host` for DDS discovery and same-host UDP. ArduPilot (not PX4) on both SITL and the real drone, with MAVROS via `apm.launch`. Custom message packages live in `shared/atl4s_msgs/` once a service needs them. Foxglove Studio is the visualization client.

## Infrastructure

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| GCP project | ATL4S |
| VM | `arachnid-atl4s-vm`, `northamerica-northeast1-c` |
| Machine | g2-standard-8, 1× NVIDIA L4 (24 GB), Ubuntu 22.04, 500 GB SSD |
| GCS bucket | `gs://atl4s-rosbags` (us-east4) |
| External IP | static, reserved |
| Access | VS Code Remote-SSH + Claude Code, or MobaXterm |

Cost discipline: stop the VM when idle.

```bash
gcloud compute instances stop arachnid-atl4s-vm --zone=northamerica-northeast1-c
gcloud compute instances start arachnid-atl4s-vm --zone=northamerica-northeast1-c
```

Running cost: ~$17/day on-demand. Stopped cost: ~$0.07/day (persistent disk only).
